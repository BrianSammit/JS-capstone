# JS-capstone

This project consist on a endless runner game. Made on phaser 3

You can see the original design [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/14554909/liFEsTlye-Mobile-version)
Design idea by [Nelson Sakwa on Behance](https://www.behance.net/sakwadesignstudio)

On the navbar, I include a button for more categories because I want to include all the categories existing for the topic.
In the original project, the forms, and the article doesn't have design, so I created my designs trying to follow the guidelines of the given design.
