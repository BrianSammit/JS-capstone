## Game Design

### Introduction

I was requested to build an endless run game, with different scenes. The game consists on go as far as you can. You gain a point for every second you are with life.

### Story and Gameplay

A Zombie apocalypse caused for a virus in 2030 destroyed the civilization, A zombie is a character without any thinking that only goes stray try to find a reason for life avoiding obstacles presented on the world. The main reason for the zombie is to pass the virus to humans and he goes traveling trying to find any human to infected.

### Objective

- Go as far as you can.

### Assets

I created the sprites for the animations because a find the images but not as sprites. With the music, I try to implement a sound post-apocalyptic to make the game more enjoyable. The Acknowledgments of the music is in the Acknowledgments section. I use a background and a ground with different speeds to create the effect of moving.
